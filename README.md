# Jimbo's Jungle Jym
*A fast-paced platformer with a focus on skills and movement techniques!*<br>

Self proclaimed "cool dude with a chill mood" and the owner of a gym (in the middle of the woods?).<br>
He's always wearing his cap, shoes, shades, and *especially* his high-grip climbing gloves, which enable him to climb up even the steepest cliffs!<br>
Don't try to climb for too long though...<br><br>

His other skills apparently include jumping off walls. He put that in his resume..?<br><br>
