Self proclaimed "cool dude with a chill mood" and the owner of a gym (in the middle of the woods?).<br>
He's always wearing his cap, shoes, shades, and *especially* his high-grip climbing gloves, which enable him to climb up even the steepest cliffs!<br>
His skills include... climbing and jumping. *He put that on a resume?*<br><br>
## The Story
Ahem. Anyways. Being in the middle of a forest has allowed Jimbo to greatly expand his, er... "Jym". He calls it that. I guess.<br>
...But it seems he's accidentally locked himself out of every door! And he's lost his keycard in the back room!<br>
Now he has to scrape up enough dough to pay the fees and make it back to the back room and retrieve his keycard...
